            ANU Exploration Robotics is a student-run club operating in Canberra. Our focus
            is on the exploration and surveying of the world around us through the use of
            custom-made, autonomous robots. To accommodate this goal, we enter competitions
            on the world stage, allowing us and our robots to gain experience that can be
            used on sustainable initiatives.

            RoboSub is an international student competition run by RoboNation and held
            annually in the United States. Teams build autonomous underwater vehicles that
            complete a course of tasks with no operator input and no tether once the vehicle
            is released. Tasks include navigating gates, identifying and localising objects
            by computer vision, homing on acoustic pingers, and releasing markers. Teams are
            also assessed on a technical design report and a design presentation.
